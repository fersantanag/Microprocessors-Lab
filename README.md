Microprocessors Lab Files and final project on a Quadcopter, with @jorgecalvar 

On folder "Projecto Final" we find the files for the final project, which consists of the creation of a quadcopter drone controlled by the PIC32.
drone controlled by the PIC32. The drone consists of the following sensors:
- Bluetooth module: which will allow communication with the controller app on the mobile phone.
cell phone.
- LED lights: they will blink to give a little joy to the drone.
- Ultrasonic sensor: shows the proximity of objects to the drone.
- Four motors: are connected through 4 ESCs (Electronic Speed Controllers) and are controlled with PWM waves of
controlled with PWM waves between 1 and 2us at high level, similar to a servo.
- Gyroscope: we will use the MPU6050 which uses the I2C communications protocol.
